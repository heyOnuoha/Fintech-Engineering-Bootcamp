# Accounting For Developers: Accounting 101

Fintech is one of the most interesting topics in tech, yet there is so little information available on how to get started as a developer. Fintech is a blend of traditional finance/accounting and the use of software engineering expertise to build highly scalable accounting tools.

You might be wondering, if it's 'FinTech,' that is, Financial Technology, why are we learning about Accounting and not Finance? This is a totally valid question, and I'll go into details about that.

## Finance Vs. Accounting

Finance and Accounting are two closely related to each other However, they are distinct fields with different focuses.

Accounting is primarily concerned with the recording and reporting of financial transactions, including the preparation of financial statements like profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. Accounting provides a historical view of a company's financial performance and position at a specific point in time. Accounting is essential for compliance with laws and regulations and serves as the foundation for financial reporting and analysis​.

Finance, on the other hand, is a broader concept that involves managing financial resources and making strategic decisions based on accounting data. It includes activities such as investing, borrowing, lending, budgeting, and forecasting. Finance focuses on future-looking aspects, using past data from accounting to make decisions about fundraising for future projects, efficient resource utilization, and profitability. Finance also integrates data from other fields like economics, statistics, and taxation​.

## Contra Accounts

Contra accounts are unique types of accounts used to offset the balance of a related account. They have opposite balances to the accounts they relate to and are used to adjust the value of these accounts.

The best way to visualize contra accounts is by thinking of them as mechanisms that partially reverse the effects of another account. They effectively reduce the value of a related account, thereby adjusting its impact on the balance sheet.

### Characteristics of Contra Accounts

- Opposite Balance: A contra account carries a balance opposite to it's related paired account. Example: If the related account normally has a debit balance, the contra account will have a credit balance, and vice versa.

- Pairing with Other Accounts: Contra accounts are always paired with a specific account and are used to adjust or offset that account's balance.

- Net Effect on Financial Statement: When a contra account and it's related account are reported in a financial statement, they are usually presented as a single net amount.

### Type of Contra Accounts

### Accumlated Depreciation (Paired with Fixed Assets)

Accumulated Depreciation account offsets asset accounts like equipment, vehicles, or buildings. While the asset account records the original cost of the asset, the accumulated depreciation account records the total depreciation of that asset over time.

Example: If a company buys a machine for $10,000 and it depreciates by $1,000 each year, the accumulated depreciation account will have a credit balance of $1,000 in the first year, $2,000 in the second year, and so on.

### Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (Paired with Accounts Receivable)

This account is used to estimate the portion of accounts receivable that is expected to be uncollectible.

Example: If a company has accounts receivable of $50,000 and estimates that $5,000 will not be collected, the allowance for doubtful accounts will have a credit balance of $5,000.

### Sales Returns and Allowances (Paired with Sales Revenue)

This account is used to record the sales that have been returned or allowances provided to customers post-sale.

Example: If a company makes sales worth $100,000 but customers return goods worth $2,000, the sales returns and allowances account will have a debit balance of $2,000.

In summary, contra accounts are essential in providing a more accurate and truthful representation of a company's financial position by offsetting the values of related primary accounts.

### Debits and Credits

A debit (Dr) is an entry on the left side of an account. It can incre
